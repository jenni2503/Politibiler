My choices
-folder for pages where all components will be store
-contribute to structure and scalability
-keeping the design simple and responsive

-unit testing: testing small chunks of our code
-how they render
-how they respond to user actions
-vitest built with testing modern javascript applications
-supports typescript and jsx

LandingPage.tsx
why passing state as props
-lifting state
-share same state
-cant pass props to siblings
-fetching data
-sort in ascending order

CarFilter.tsx
why two filter?
-assumed that the user can filter brands and, or status
useEffect
unique collaction of brands and status

Card.tsx
take filteredCars state
display the data/new values
map

UpdateStatus.tsx
-ternary operator, having two buttons, one input field and ptag
-handleEditClick
-showing fictional call
-using PATCH since we want to update parts of the resource which would be the status

considering
-filtering ideas
-make search field and filter by userinput
-make drawer with checkbox so that users can filter by checbox (more complex and complicated for this solution)

further develop
-want to add images to show police cars for visual appealing
